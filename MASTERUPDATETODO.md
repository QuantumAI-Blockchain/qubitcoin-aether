### RUST P2P ACTIVATION (Pre-Launch — Option A)

**Decision:** Activate Rust libp2p as the primary P2P layer before launch. Python P2P becomes fallback only.
**Rationale:** Rust libp2p is faster, has NAT traversal, gossipsub, Kademlia DHT, QUIC transport.
**Current state:** RP1-RP3 complete — proto expanded (9 RPCs), Python stubs generated, bridge + event loop rewritten, Rust compiles. Remaining: RP4-RP8 (daemon launch, Python streaming client, Docker, flip default, tests).

| # | Priority | File(s) | Task | Details | Effort |
|---|----------|---------|------|---------|--------|
| **RP1** | ~~CRITICAL~~ DONE | `rust-p2p/proto/p2p_service.proto` | ~~Expand gRPC API + generate Python stubs~~ | Expanded proto from 2→9 RPCs (3 outbound, 3 streaming, 3 queries). Generated Python stubs. Updated `rust_p2p_client.py` for renamed message. `cargo build --release` passes. | DONE |
| **RP2** | ~~CRITICAL~~ DONE | `rust-p2p/src/main.rs` | ~~Fix channel wiring in event loop~~ | Rewrote event loop: converts `NetworkMessage` → `NetworkEvent`, broadcasts via `event_tx` channel to all streaming clients. Added `P2PStats` with atomic counters. Env-configurable ports. | DONE |
| **RP3** | ~~CRITICAL~~ DONE | `rust-p2p/src/bridge/mod.rs` | ~~Implement bidirectional gRPC streaming~~ | Full rewrite: all 9 RPC implementations. Server-streaming via `BroadcastStream`. Stats tracking. `start_grpc_server()` takes `event_tx` + `stats`. ~296 lines replacing ~83. | DONE |
| **RP4** | ~~CRITICAL~~ DONE | `src/qubitcoin/node.py` | ~~Launch Rust daemon + lifecycle management~~ | `_start_rust_p2p_daemon()`: locates binary, launches with Popen, waits for gRPC health check, graceful shutdown (SIGTERM→SIGKILL). Config: `RUST_P2P_BINARY`, `RUST_P2P_STARTUP_TIMEOUT`. Falls back to Python P2P if binary missing or daemon dies. | DONE |
| **RP5** | ~~CRITICAL~~ DONE | `src/qubitcoin/network/rust_p2p_client.py` | ~~Rewrite Python gRPC client for streaming~~ | Full rewrite: all 9 RPCs. Async streaming via `grpc.aio` (lazy import). `stream_blocks(on_block)` + `stream_transactions(on_tx)` as async generators. `start_streaming()` launches background tasks. Routes blocks to consensus, txs to mempool. | DONE |
| **RP6** | ~~HIGH~~ DONE | `Dockerfile` + `docker-compose.yml` | ~~Docker integration~~ | Dockerfile already had multi-stage Rust build. Added proto stub COPY. `_start_rust_p2p_daemon` checks PATH as fallback (Docker: `/usr/local/bin/`). `.env.example` updated with new config vars. | DONE |
| **RP7** | ~~HIGH~~ DONE | `src/qubitcoin/config.py` | ~~Flip default to ENABLE_RUST_P2P=true~~ | Default changed from `false` to `true`. Updated CLAUDE.md known issues. Falls back to Python P2P if Rust binary missing or daemon fails. | DONE |
| **RP8** | ~~MEDIUM~~ DONE | `tests/unit/test_rust_p2p.py` | ~~Add unit tests for Rust P2P client~~ | 33 tests: init, broadcast block/tx/submit, peer stats/list, health check, disconnect, streaming, edge cases. All mocked with NullHandler for Rich compat. | DONE |

- 4 LOW-priority enhancements
- 120 total improvements across 6 components (20 each)

**Regressions found:** None (Run #1 — no prior baseline)

**Key verdicts by component:**
1. **Frontend:** 88-92% production-ready. Zero placeholder pages. All 7 pages wire real API data.
2. **L1 Blockchain Core:** Production-ready. Real quantum computation, Dilithium2 crypto, atomic UTXO model.
3. **QVM (L2):** Production-ready. 155 EVM + 19 quantum opcodes. 49 real Solidity contracts.
4. **Aether Tree (L3):** 75% ready. Core reasoning is REAL AGI. Behavioral integration incomplete (~25%).
5. **QBC Economics:** 95% ready. Phi-halving mathematically verified. Fee systems implemented.
6. **QUSD Stablecoin:** 90% ready. 7 real contracts. Needs deployment + oracle initialization.

### Run #26 — February 27, 2026

**Scope:** Full v2.1 protocol audit — 8 parallel deep-dive agents reading ALL source files. Exchange, Bridge, Launchpad audited as MAJOR components. Every L1/L2/L3 file read at source level.

**Items completed this run: 0** (audit-only run, no code changes)

**New items discovered: 40** (20 L1/L2 backend + 20 improvements across all components)

**Key findings by component:**

**L1 Blockchain Core (78/100):**
- **2 CRITICAL**: `/transfer` unauthenticated (F2), `/mining/start|stop` unauthenticated (F1)
- **6 HIGH**: Fork resolution race (F3/F4), `eth_sendRawTransaction` balance model mismatch (F5), `eth_sendTransaction` no auth (F6), Dilithium dev fallback structurally insecure (F7), difficulty cache stale after reorg (F8)
- **7 MEDIUM**: LRU cache waste (F9), P2P tx gossip without validation (F10), `/wallet/create` returns pk (F11), empty PRIVATE_KEY_HEX crash (F12), 2-hour future timestamp (F13), tx hash SHA-256 vs Keccak (F14), SSRF via /p2p/connect (F15)
- **Consensus/crypto/UTXO verified CORRECT**: phi-halving, difficulty adjustment, Dilithium2 usage, double-spend prevention, coinbase maturity all sound
- **20 specific improvements with file:line references**

**L2 QVM Python (87/100):**
- **3 CRITICAL**: ecRecover placeholder (SHA-256 instead of ECDSA), CALLCODE stub, QVERIFY trivially passes
- **5 HIGH**: blake2f stub, QRISK hardcoded (returns 10), QRISK_SYSTEMIC hardcoded (returns 5), QBRIDGE_VERIFY trivially passes, keccak256 fallback to SHA-256
- **3 MEDIUM**: No warm/cold SLOAD gas, StateManager address derivation inconsistency, compliance cache key concern
- **152/155 EVM opcodes fully implemented, 3 partial/stub**
- **15/19 quantum opcodes real logic, 4 simplified**

**L2 Smart Contracts (91/100):**
- **51 contracts found** (not 49 — wQBC exists in both tokens/ and bridge/)
- **38 Grade A, 6 Grade B, 0 Grade C or below**
- **KEY FIX NEEDED**: Vote weight caller-provided in QUSDGovernance.sol:88, TreasuryDAO.sol:88, UpgradeGovernor.sol:83
- **SynapticStaking uses transfer() not call()** — 2300 gas limit risk
- **QUSDAllocation dual initialization** — initializeBase() unguarded
- **10 QVM-side + 10 contract-side improvements**

**L3 Aether Tree (72/100) — PARTIALLY GENUINE:**
- Phi growth is ORGANIC (5 anti-gaming defenses: maturity gating, milestone gates, redundancy detection, cosine similarity, node-type entropy)
- Real graph-based reasoning with backtracking, deductive/inductive/abductive chains
- Sephirot nodes are genuinely distinct (unique quantum states, SUSY pairs, energy levels)
- 22 findings, 20 improvements

**Exchange DEX (64/100) — FACADE:**
- Beautiful UI, zero trading capability, all data from MockDataEngine(seed=42)
- Order submission is `setTimeout(600ms)` with toast — no API call, no state change
- 2 innerHTML XSS vectors UNFIXED since Run #25
- Only 1 ARIA attribute in 26 files
- Backend has ZERO exchange endpoints — minimum 18 endpoint groups needed (8-15K LOC)

**Bridge (54/100) — FACADE:**
- Backend has 10 files (~2,800 LOC) with real Web3/Solana SDK integration
- Frontend makes zero API calls — 3 CRITICAL from Run #25 still unfixed
- Architecturally mature backend (federated validators, proof store, relayer incentives)

**Launchpad (39/100) — FACADE:**
- Deploy wizard collects 7 steps of input then discards ALL of it
- `generateDeployResult()` returns `Math.random()` contract addresses
- Backend `POST /contracts/deploy` exists but is never called

**Economics (62/100) + QUSD (68/100) — PARTIALLY REAL:**
- **CRITICAL**: Emission schedule `15.27 / PHI^era` converges to ~651M QBC (19.75% of 3.3B max supply)
- **CRITICAL**: Config.display() shows fabricated 100% projections
- QUSD contracts individually real but NOT cross-wired (mint doesn't call DebtLedger)
- QUSDGovernance vote() weight is caller-supplied, not verified on-chain

**Frontend Core (62/100):**
- Explorer 100% mock data, 4 CRITICAL, 8 HIGH, 9 MEDIUM
- OpenAI API key stored in localStorage
- MetaMask gas estimate hardcoded to 21000
- QVM deploy button is dead (no onClick handler)

**Files changed: 2** (REVIEW.md, MASTERUPDATETODO.md)

**Score change:** 96 → 72 (full-stack weighted scoring replaces backend-only score)

**Cumulative progress:** 126/243 completed (51.9%) — 203→243 items (+40 new items), 126→126 completed (+0).

## 9. SECURITY & ACCESSIBILITY ITEMS (Run #25 — NEW)

### 9.1 Security Fixes (9 items)

| # | Priority | Task | Component | Details |
|---|----------|------|-----------|---------|
| **SEC01** | HIGH | Fix innerHTML XSS in DepthChart tooltip | Exchange | DX-NEW-1: Replace `tooltip.innerHTML` with DOM API (`createElement`, `textContent`) |
| **SEC02** | HIGH | Fix innerHTML XSS in LiquidationHeatmap tooltip | Exchange | DX-NEW-2: Same pattern as SEC01 |
| **SEC03** | MEDIUM | Fix Bridge sign flow generating non-existent txId | Bridge | BR-NEW-3: Generated txId must exist in data source or redirect to pending view |
| **SEC04** | MEDIUM | Propagate Bridge wallet state to all consumers | Bridge | BR-NEW-2: Move `ConnectionState` to Zustand store, read from BridgePanel/GlobalHeader |
| **SEC05** | **HIGH** | Remove or gate `/wallet/sign` endpoint | Backend | BE-NEW-4: Accepts private key over HTTP — appears in logs, memory, never zeroized. Should be client-side only or gated to localhost. |
| **SEC06** | MEDIUM | Add authentication to mining control endpoints | Backend | BE-NEW-3: `/mining/start`, `/mining/stop`, `/aether/knowledge/prune` lack auth — any client can start/stop mining |
| **SEC07** | MEDIUM | Use `hmac.compare_digest` for admin API key comparison | Backend | BE-NEW-1: `admin_api.py:70,77` uses `==` operator — timing attack leaks key length and prefix |
| **SEC08** | LOW | Fix fork resolution supply revert query | Backend | BE-NEW-5: `consensus/engine.py:720-727` uses `NOT spent` filter — undercounts `total_minted` after reorg |
| **SEC09** | LOW | Fix admin rate limiter IP eviction | Backend | BE-NEW-2: `admin_api.py:46-48` — defaultdict never evicts empty IP keys (unbounded memory growth) |

| **A11Y04** | HIGH | Add `role="dialog"`, `aria-modal`, focus trap to Bridge modals | Bridge | BR-NEW-17/18/19: PreFlightModal, WalletModal, SettingsPanel need ARIA |
| **A11Y05** | MEDIUM | Add `htmlFor`/`id` to all form labels in DeployWizard | Launchpad | LP-NEW-11: Labels are `<div>` not `<label>`, inputs lack `id` |
| **A11Y06** | MEDIUM | Add text alternatives to canvas/SVG visualizations | Explorer | EX-NEW-9/10: HeartbeatMonitor canvas and ForceGraph SVG need `aria-label` |
